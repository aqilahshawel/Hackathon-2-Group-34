
Monday morning arrived and you woke up due to mom's constant lecture.
Before leaving the house mom reminded you to buy lunch at Aunt May's cafeteria.
Closing the house door in a rush almost made you fell, this resulted in your limited edition 
chess set that was gifted by Uncle Ben to scatter on the ground.
In front of you are 3 chess pieces, which would you like to pick up first? 
 
1. The Bishop
2. The Queen
3. The Knight
