
You have a curfew of 5pm and right now it's currently 4.40pm
On your way to the bus stop you saw a kitten that was stuck on a tree crying for help.
What would you do?

1. Help the kitten on your own
2. Pass by because you have to be at home before curfew
3. Inform the nearest available people about the cat
